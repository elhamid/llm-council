Calls out `X-Accel-Buffering: no` for Nginx and ties it to “connects but nothing arrives,” which is a frequent SSE failure mode.\n- **Usefulness:** Very high. Provides a direct `curl` header inspection command and a CI-friendly smoke test with a clear pass/fail metric.\n\n### Response B\n- **Accuracy:** Mixed. Correct that buffering is a core risk, but it overfocuses on “token streaming” and implies `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` as a target header (often incidental and not a required SSE correctness condition).\n- **Insight:** Moderate. The buffering diagnosis is valid, but the “generate multi-token text response” is not an SSE-header check.\n- **Usefulness:** Low–moderate.

It also correctly identifies the highest-probability technical risk (Nginx/proxy buffering) and provides the specific header to fix it (`X-Accel-Buffering`).\n\nResponse B:\n**Critique:** Misinterprets the prompt as a request for the LLM to *act* as the SSE server, rather than advising the user on how to check their own.

Provides concrete curl commands, specific headers to verify, common pitfalls (proxy buffering), and both manual + automated testing approaches. The killer question about infrastructure (Nginx/Cloudflare/etc.) is genuinely useful. Clear pass/fail criteria with 2-second TTFB threshold.\n\n**Weaknesses:** May be over-engineered for a simple \"ping\" request. The user's terse prompt suggests they might want a quick confirmation, not a full implementation guide. However, this thoroughness could be exactly what's needed if they're debugging.\n\n**Verdict:** Best technical answer, though possibly over-scoped.\n\n---\n\n## Response B\n**Strengths:** Correctly identifies this as a verification probe. The \"Chunk Count\" metric (>1 chunks = pass) is clever and directly tests streaming behavior. Acknowledges middleware buffering as the primary risk. Generates actual content to test with.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Somewhat meta—treats the prompt itself as the test payload rather than providing testing instructions. The \"this text block serves as data payload\" approach is creative but assumes the user is already connected and just needs content to stream. Doesn't provide actionable testing steps like Response A.\n\n**Verdict:** Insightful but less actionable.\n\n---\n\n## Response C\n**Strengths:** Excellent critical analysis. Correctly identifies ambiguity in the prompt and multiple possible interpretations. The \"answering the wrong question\" risk is spot-on. Provides minimal viable response with explicit assumptions.\n\n**Weaknesses:** This IS the Critic role response, so it's doing exactly what it should—but as a standalone answer to the user, it's too cautious. The minimal response is good but less comprehensive than Response A. Asks a clarifying question but doesn't commit to a full answer.\n\n**Verdict:** Perfect for a Critic, but incomplete as a primary response.\n\n---\n\n## Response D\n**Strengths:** Concise and direct. Provides immediate SSE-formatted response (\"Pong\") that could literally be used as a test payload. The 60-second connection metric is simple. Acknowledges the bold WebSocket alternative with honest skepticism (\"why overengineer?\").\n\n**Weaknesses:** Too minimal—doesn't explain *how* to verify headers or test properly. The WebSocket suggestion contradicts the user's explicit SSE focus. Lacks the diagnostic depth needed if the user is actually debugging a problem.\n\n**Verdict:** Quick but shallow.\n\n---\n\n# FINAL RANKING\n\n1. **Response A** - Most comprehensive, actionable, and technically sound.

More conceptual than actionable.\n\n4. **Response D** - Too brief and the WebSocket tangent is off-target.
