It attempts to follow the formatting constraint (2 bullets) by outlining what it needs and what it will do next. It is helpful and conversational.\n*   **Rating:** Good.\n\n**Response B**\n*   **Critique:** This model handles the missing input cleverly by using the requested format (2 bullets) to provide a status report (\"Missing Input\" and \"Ready to Process\"). This is the most creative and adherent way to handle a user error while sticking to the output constraints.\n*   **Rating:** Excellent.\n\n**Response C**\n*   **Critique:** The model correctly identifies the missing input and politely asks for it. However, it ignores the \"2 bullets\" constraint. While it's hard to summarize nothing in bullets, Response B showed it was possible to use the format for the refusal.\n*   **Rating:** Satisfactory.\n\n**Response D**\n*   **Critique:** This is a complete failure. The model has hallucinated context or, more likely, leaked a summary of its own system instructions/safety policy (e.g., \"Core prohibitions,\" \"No assistance with criminal activity\"). Since the user provided no text, this response is irrelevant, confusing, and represents a safety/alignment failure.\n*   **Rating:** Failure.\n\n**FINAL RANKING**\n1. Response B\n2. Response A\n3.

The \"Ready to Process\" framing is professional and reassuring, though the formatting is somewhat redundant given the simple request.\n\n**Response C:** Brief and polite acknowledgment of missing content. Gets straight to the point but offers less guidance on what information would be helpful to provide. Most concise but least informative.\n\n**Response D:** Completely misunderstands the request. Appears to summarize some internal policy document that wasn't part of the user's prompt.
